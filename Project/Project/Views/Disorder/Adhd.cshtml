                Strategies for Learning Disabilities: Frustration
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Try and provide structures and routine. The more a learner can predict and expect, the less frustration.</li>
                    <li>Try and identify antecedents to frustration-so that they can either be eliminated and or modified.</li>
                    <li>Create opportunities for success.</li>
                    <li>Monitor work closely and provide feedback often.</li>
                    <li>Provide an alternative for acting out-a place the can go when they feel frustrated.</li>
                    <li>Help other students identify the signs of frustration-so that frustration may be more quickly diffused</li>
                    <li>Try and identify when it is time to take a break and do something different.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Have a plan in place to deal with aggressive situations.</li>
                    <li>Try and identify when it is time to take a break and do something different.</li>
                </ol>
